# USB Debug Status

USB Debug Status is an Android home screen widget that indicates whether USB
debugging is on. The indicator at the top right of the widget will be red if
USB debugging is off or green if it is on. Clicking the widget will open the
Developer options screen.

After adding the widget to your home screen, you may need to restart your phone
for it to work properly. I haven't figured out why this is sometimes necessary.
